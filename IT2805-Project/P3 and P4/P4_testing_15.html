				<h3>Testing document</h3>
				<p>
                In the testing of Hårfin, we chose to conduct both quantitative and qualitative testing to capture a holistic perspective. 
                An online questionnaire was sent out for people to test, and live testings with observation followed by interviews were 
                conducted with people in the target group. In total there were 32 people testing the website from the online form and 5 live 
                testings completed. As the goal of the project testing is to collect feedback to improve the website and prevent design and 
                implementation flaws, open-ended questions and tasks to complete were in focus as we are looking for customer experiences 
                and mapping out problems when navigation through the website.  
                </p>
                <h4> Questionnaire: Quantitative </h4>
                <p>
                    A google form was sent out to people in the target group. The first part of the form contains demographics and hair salon usage. The form also collects information about what device and internet reader they are using. The second part of the questionnaire gave the participants a link to the webpage of Hårfin and three tasks to complete. The participants were asked to grade the usability from 1 (easy) to 5 (hard) to complete. The final part was general questions about the navigation and design of the website. The last part contained open-ended questions.

                <h4>Live testing and observation: Qualitative </h4>
                <p>
                        Potential users from the target audience were invited to participate in live testings of the website. 
                        In total five persons participated. The goal of the test was to identify potential problem areas of the 
                        site and see how navigated through the site. Before starting the test, the participants got an 
                        introduction to the course, the goal of the test and instructions on how to think out loud. The participants 
                        were given tasks they had to complete such as “find the address of Hårfin Solsiden” and “book an appointment 
                        with Frida Frisør” and more. While they were executing tasks they were thinking out loud such as “to find that 
                        information would expect to find it under about us”. After completing a set of tasks, they were interviewed 
                        further tying to identified parts that made them confused and how to improve.

				<h3>Tester Audience</h3>
				<p>Of the audience taking part in the online questionnaire (n=32), 69% were women. Almost 95% of the participants were in the same age range as Hårfin is intended for. 75% were 18-25 years old, and 20% were between 26-40 years old. When it comes to hair salon usage, 59% have booked a hair salon appointment from a web-site before and 76% are using hair salon services. Of the participants, 66% are based in Trondheim. From the live testing, all the participants belonged in the target group (n=5, age median= 24,  5 females, based in Trondheim). With the majority of the participants being to the target group of Hårfin, we conclude that the results are valid for the purpose of the testing.

				<h3>Testing Platform</h3>
				<p>When sending out the questionnaire we stated that using a desktop was recommended. However, to be certain, we asked which device and browser the participants were using during the test. It turned out that almost half of the participants used a mobile phone during the test. Our website is not built to be mobile-friendly, and they would have usability issues such as small text and navigational issues such as booking an appointment or using the dropdown menu. For the live testings, a desktop with Chrome was used.</p>

				<h3>Feedback Summary </h3>
                <h4>Iterations</h4>
                <p>
                        We ran testings parallel to fine-tuning the website. After the first testings and observations, we were able to make improvements on the website. An earlier version had inconsistencies in the content of the service offerings and booking form. This has since been updated, and now the price-list and booking are coherent. Another inconsistency was the footer that contained a different phone number than the salon pages. Some of the participants found the use of “hjemmeside” to be uncommon and preferred the word “hjem”. Other changes that were made had to deal with heading and the use of white space. In an earlier version, the time input used to a different input type that many people had troubles with, this has since been changed to a dropdown menu where people can click on what hour they want the service.

                <h4>Design</h4>
                <h5>Clear and modern appearance</h5>
                <p>		
                        Participants were asked to describe Hårfin with three adjectives. Some of the words describing the site were “modern, clean, user-friendly, easy, feminine, esthetic, fresh”, even though one person described the website as “clean, user-friendly but boring” the majority had a positive view of Hårfin. Also, some participants mentioned that the target group probably was women which indicated that the testers have an aligned perspective and the goals of the site. The website received a lot of positive feedback on the design. Some comments were (in Norwegian)
                </p>
                <div id="quotes"> 
                <p>    
                    <q>Synes den var oversiktlig og lett å finne fram på. Likte også fargetemaet på nettsiden da den var behaglig å se på. </q> <br> <br>

                    <q>Nettsiden ser veldig bra ut. Det er lett å finne den informasjonen man trenger. Nice at den har en kalkulator for deg når du bestiller time. Liker at headeren følger med når man scroller</q> <br> <br>
                        
                    <q>Fancy side. Ser profft ut med bilder og farger og slikt.</q>
                </p>
                </div>

                <h5>Perceived Inactive buttons on homepage and booking</h5>
                <p>One participant during the observation mentioned that the button on the landing page seemed to be inactive. “Since the button is a bit faded, it could seem like it is inactive, I could say the same for the button at the booking page. When I put the mouse above it, I see that it’s active ”. This was only mentioned by one person, and since all the participants managed to successfully book an appointment it is not considered a usability flaw. However, the font color’s transparency should be fully solid, making the buttons look “more” active.  </p>
                
                <h5>Navigation tasks</h5>
                <p>None of the testers appeared to have trouble navigating between the different pages and all the participants found the navigation tasks to be easy. On a scale where 1 indicates that it was easy and 5 indicates it was difficult. Find the price- task got an average of score 1, and the phone number- task got an average of 1,5. Two of the participants from the online questionnaire said that they would expect to find the phone number for Øya on the page “about us”. Two of the participants from the observation also clicked first on “about us” when trying to find the phone number. However, both of them considered themselves “done with the task” when they found the phone number in the footer. The other three participants went directly into the salon page.  In general, it is positive to have essential information on various places on the website as people have different mental models of where they expect to find information.</p>

                <h4>Content</h4>
                <h5>Booking</h5>
                <p>
                        Two persons suggested that the price of the services also should be located next to the service in the form. Some people also found it frustrating that it was possible to select all “cut”, “cut + wash” and “trimming”.  
                </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Usability</h4>
                <h5>Easy booking</h5>
                <p>From the questionnaire, the participants got a task to book an appointment with a stylist. The average score by desktop users was 1,7 on a scale where 1 indicates that it was easy and 5 indicates it was difficult. It is concluded that the majority of the participants found the booking easy. </p>
                
                <h5>Hairdresser and salon input</h5>
                <p>One user struggled with the stylist and hair salon inputs. She thought it was weird that the salon got selected when she chose a hairstylist. As well, if she changed the hair salon, the hairstylist got changed without her noticing. This is a red flag for the usability of the form. </p>
            
                <h5>Front image loading time</h5>
                <p>We got a comment from the questionnaire that the front image takes a while to load. This could happen because the person has a slow connection or because it is the first time the page in loaded in that person’s browser. However, this is something we should look into.</p>
                
                <h5>Only book once an hour</h5>
                <p>One person said “It was easy to book, find prices, but it is a bit weird that I can only book once an hour” </p>
            
                <h5>The total price</h5>
                <p>Some people mentioned in the google form that they really liked that the price of the services was automatically calculated. However, one of the persons said that they were surprised by the price when they scrolled down and suggested that having the price next to all the services would be better. The total price also lacks “kr” at the end of the field. </p>
                
                <h5>Browser compatibility</h5>
                <p>Most of the participants used Chrome (23) as the browser. People also used Safari (6), Opera (1), Samsung Internet (1), and Firebox (1). Luckily, none of them used Internet Explorer. We have since discovered that the site is not functional in Internet Explorer. </p>

				<h3>Our response</h3>
                <p>
                        We were quite pleased with the feedback on the overall design and appearance of the page. The majority of the people described the site as modern, clean and feminine. Even though our client is fictive, we are quite happy that we were able to capture the design goals as we stated we wanted to build a website that was clean and modern. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   One of the main functions and goals of this site was to make the booking easy. Most people found this easy, however, there are some seemingly minor details that could have a significant negative effect on the usability of the booking system. For instance with the selection of salon and hairstylist. One example for improvement of the form would be for the customer to select the hair salon first, then the rest of the form with hairstylists, services, data and hour would appear and/or be clickable. It has to be clear for the user <b>which</b> salon they are booking at, as we don’t want clients thinking they booked an appointment with a stylist at a different location.
                   We have discussed a few ideas for improvement and concluded that we would need to test various solutions with end-users.
                   The booking confirmation should include all the information about the booking, such at salon, styling, date, hour and service if applicable. 
                </p>
                <p>For the services under the cut section, there were some issues, and we agree that is doesn’t make sense that people can select “cut”, “cut + wash” and “trimming” in the same booking. One improvement could be radio buttons. With radio buttons, customers can only select one type of cut service. </p>
                <p>In general, it has been insightful experience working on this group project with students from different programs, and learning to use new programs such as Figma, GitKraken and learning new languages JavaScript, CSS and HTML. </p>
